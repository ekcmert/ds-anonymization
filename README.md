Data anonymization is essential for protecting privacy in sensitive applications, and techniques such as k-Anonymity, l-Diversity, and t-Closeness along with their combinationsâ€”have emerged as critical tools in this domain. In this study, we employ the UCI Adult dataset to systematically evaluate the effectiveness and trade-offs of these methods. We assess privacy preservation using metrics including re-identification and disclosure risks, while the privacy-utility balance is examined through measures of information loss, model performance, distortion metrics, and suppression ratios. By leveraging the discernibility metric and the average equivalence class size metric, we determine optimal parameter settings for k, l, and t, thereby enhancing attack resilience without unduly compromising data utility. Our comprehensive analysis, which incorporates the performance of several machine learning models, offers actionable insights into optimizing anonymization strategies for real-world applications, ultimately guiding the development of robust privacy-preserving techniques that effectively balance data protection and practical utility.
